        <h1>About Addis Ababa</h1>
        <h2>Sometimes referred to as the capital of Africa, Addis Ababa is a buzzing hub of economic, 
            social and political activity and home to such notable offices as the African Union and 
            the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. 
            The diversity of its people is reflected in the many churches, mosques and museums, including the Ethiopian National Museum
             which houses the fossilized skeleton of Dinkinesh, or Lucy, the Australopithecine discovered in the area in the 1970s.</h2>
